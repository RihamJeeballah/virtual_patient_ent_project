# Ear Pain (Otalgia)

## Opening Stem
A 26-year-old woman presents with right ear pain for 3 days after a beach trip. No long-term illnesses known.

## History of Present Illness
- **Onset/course:** Started the morning after swimming in the sea; gradually worsened over 72 hours.  
- **Character/severity:** Deep ache with occasional sharp twinges, 7/10, throbbier at night.  
- **Exacerbating/relieving:** Pulling the pinna or pressing the tragus worsens pain; chewing and wide mouth opening increase discomfort. Minimal relief with ibuprofen 400 mg twice daily. Warm compress helps.  
- **Associated symptoms:** Canal itch, sense of blockage, scant watery → now yellowish discharge. Mild hearing reduction on the right. No tinnitus, vertigo, or facial weakness.  
- **Context/exposures:** Swam daily; often leaves ears wet; uses cotton swabs after showering. No recent air travel.  
- **Negative/red flags:** No diabetes, immunosuppression, high fever, mastoid pain, or trauma.

## Ideas, Concerns, Expectations (ICE)
Thinks it’s “swimmer’s ear.” Concerned about pain and sleep. Expects drops and quick relief.

## Prompts / Differentiating Questions
Water exposure, ear instrumentation (Q-tips), earbuds, skin conditions.  
Discharge quality, hearing change vs tinnitus/vertigo.  
Referred pain sources (dental/TMJ, pharynx, cervical spine).  
Red flags: diabetes, nocturnal pain, cranial neuropathies, persistent fever.

## Tone
Cooperative, mildly anxious, conversational.
