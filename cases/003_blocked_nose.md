# Blocked Nose – “Can’t Breathe Through My Nose”

## Opening Stem
A 28-year-old woman complains of nasal blockage and sneezing on most days for 9 months.

## History of Present Illness
- **Pattern/time course:** Bilateral obstruction, fluctuating; worse mornings and during cleaning; spring flares. Improves at seaside and after showers.  
- **Associated symptoms:** Watery rhinorrhea, itchy eyes/nose, sneezing fits, post-nasal drip, intermittent hyposmia, occasional dull maxillary pressure.  
- **Triggers/exposures:** Bedroom carpet, plush bedding, short-haired cat sleeps on bed, dusty AC filters; uses scented candles and incense on weekends.  
- **Treatments tried:** OTC cetirizine with partial relief; tried generic intranasal steroid for 1 week only (stopped due to “no effect”). No saline rinses.  
- **Negatives/red flags:** No persistent unilateral blockage, no recurrent epistaxis, facial swelling, dental pain, or vision changes. No recent febrile sinusitis.  
- **AERD/atopy context:** Mild childhood asthma; took ibuprofen recently and developed wheeze—now avoids NSAIDs.

## Past Medical History
Atopy: allergic conjunctivitis in spring, mild intermittent asthma (rare salbutamol use).  
GERD during exam stress; no autoimmune disease.

## Past Surgical History
None. No nasal trauma or septal surgery.

## Medications
- Salbutamol inhaler PRN (rare).  
- Cetirizine 10 mg PRN during flares.  
- Combined oral contraceptive.  
- No regular intranasal therapy currently.

## Allergies
No known drug allergies. Reports itchy, watery eyes around dust and cat dander. No food anaphylaxis.

## Family History
- Mother: hay fever and asthma.  
- Brother: eczema as a child; no nasal polyposis or AERD diagnosed.

## Social History
- Final-year medical student; sleeps ~6 h/night.  
- Non-smoker, occasional coffee; rare alcohol.  
- Lives in apartment with central AC; windows closed; infrequent filter changes.  
- Pet: indoor cat (allowed on bedding).  
- Exercises: jogs outdoors weekly; symptoms improve outdoors.

## Ideas, Concerns, Expectations (ICE)
Wants to stop mouth-breathing and snoring before exams; hopes for a clear plan for daily control and when to see ENT.

## Prompts / Differentiating Questions
Perennial vs seasonal pattern; laterality; itch/sneeze (allergic) vs purulence/fever (infective).  
Home/occupational exposures (carpet, pets, AC filters, fragrances).  
Smell loss, asthma/aspirin sensitivity (AERD), prior trauma/surgery/cocaine use.  
Impact on sleep/quality of life; adherence and technique for intranasal steroids; trials of saline irrigation.

## Tone
Polite, cooperative, slightly fatigued but engaged.
