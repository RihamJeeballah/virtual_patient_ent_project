# Neck Lump – “The Painless Swelling”

## Opening Stem
A 55-year-old man reports a painless left-sided neck lump for 6 weeks.

## History of Present Illness
- **Onset/course:** Noticed incidentally while shaving; slowly enlarging.  
- **Character/location:** Upper lateral neck (approx. level II–III); “rubbery” at first, now firmer.  
- **Associated symptoms:** Intermittent sore throat, progressive hoarseness (4 weeks), dysphagia to solids, occasional unilateral referred ear pain (left). Night sweats twice weekly, ~2 kg weight loss over a month, reduced appetite.  
- **Negatives:** No dental infection, skin lesions, fever spikes, or recent URTI. No choking or dyspnea.  
- **Context:** Works long hours; noted worsening after an episode of “bad reflux.”

## Past Medical History
- Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for 10 years (on/off control).  
- Hypertension, well controlled.  
- No prior TB, radiation therapy, or head-and-neck cancer history.

## Past Surgical History
- Childhood tonsillectomy.  
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy at 48. No neck surgeries.

## Medications
- Omeprazole 20 mg daily (often forgets).  
- Amlodipine 5 mg daily.  
- Occasional antacids at night.

## Allergies
No known drug allergies. Reports seasonal dust sensitivity (sneezing).

## Family History
- Father: “throat cancer” at 62 (smoker, alcohol use).  
- Mother: hypertension.  
No familial thyroid disease or lymphoma known.

## Social History
- Runs a small café; still smokes ~1 pack/day (~40 pack-years, started at 18).  
- Alcohol: 3–4 drinks most evenings (beer or spirits).  
- Past sexual history: multiple partners; inconsistent protection in 20s–30s; monogamous now. HPV vaccination unknown.  
- Lives with spouse; no pets. No recent foreign travel.  
- Diet heavy in grilled meats; often late-night eating due to work.

## Ideas, Concerns, Expectations (ICE)
Worried about cancer, especially given father’s history. Wants to know urgency and typical next steps (imaging/biopsy).

## Prompts / Differentiating Questions
Duration > 2–3 weeks, B-symptoms, tobacco/alcohol, sexual history/HPV.  
Compressive symptoms (dysphagia, airway, voice change).  
Infections (dental, skin), TB risks, cat exposure (toxoplasma).  
Prior skin/head-and-neck lesions, radiation, occupational exposures.

## Tone
Slightly anxious, realistic, cooperative but worried.
